# Group 3 Handlebar Hero bike computer
By: Adam, Leah, Rob, Aryan

This repo contains the codebase for our bicycle computer project, the names of the files indicate which component they are for.

Please ensure that you have all dependecies installed before compiling.
The MCUFriend library used is a fork which supports the Arduino R4 WiFi found here: https://github.com/slviajero/MCUFRIEND_kbv

The display code is designed to be run on an arduino R4 WiFi with a display shield module.
The other two files are to be run on an arduino nano 33 iot.
